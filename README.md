# snake

The purpose of this project is to create abstract a CLI game engine which can allow clients to create various CLI games.

The plan is to build a snake game and later abstract reusable logic into a game engine. The reason for this approach is the belief that it may be easier to see what kind of functionality a game might need from a game engine.
